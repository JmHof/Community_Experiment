This is my private repository for the manuscript titled "Temporal changes in the role of species sorting and evolution determine community dynamics".
This is a collaborative project from members of University of Konstanz (Lutz Becks, Julius Hoffmann) and the University of Turku (Teppo Hiltunen, Shane Hogle).

The repository contains my analyses on phenotypic change, community composition, the contributions of species sorting and evolution, and population dynamics.
Shane Hogle processed and analised sequencing data (16s rRNA amplicon seq, whole genome seqeuncing, community metagenomes). His work is stored at the following repository:
https://gitlab.utu.fi/slhogl/hambiDoubleEvoHi

The folder "scripts" contains the code used for my analyses. The scripts there draw from the raw data in the folder "Data" or the "derived data" folder which contains modified data files based on the raw data.
Scripts that produce results from analyses are also present as html rmarkdown files. If the repository is downloaded/cloned and code is run essential results (plots, tables) will be saved in the "Results" folder.
